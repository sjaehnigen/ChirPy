# ChirPy

[*ChirPy*](https://github.com/sjaehnigen/chirpy) (_chiral python_) is a python package for chirality, dynamics, and molecular vibrations.


Main features:
- Computation of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) from molecular dynamics (MD) and time-correlation functions (TCF)
- Application of the periodic gauge for magnetic moments and crystal symmetry in solid-state  
- Interpretation, processing, and creation of molecular topologies and supercells
- Analysis and visualisation of MD results 
    

Furthermore:
- Scientific visualisation
- Interfacing with VMD
- Processing of volumetric data and vector fields

(... work in progress)


## Installation 
Copy or clone the repository into a local directory. Open a bash terminal and change directory to the local copy of the repository.

Make sure you have the following packages installed:
- `python` >= 3.13
- `pip` >= 25.1
- `packmol` >= 20.0 (optional)

You can also use [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) to create a *chirpy* environment from the delivered `conda_env.yml` file:
```shell
conda env create -f conda_env.yml
```

In the parent directory, run:
```shell
pip install .
```

*ChirPy* has now been installed and can be imported within a python environment:
```python
import chirpy as cp
```

Check that you installation is correct by running from a bash terminal the test suite in `tests/`:
```shell
python run_tests.py
```
or
```shell
./run_tests.py
```
(optional arguments: --verbose, --scripts)

Thank you for reporting bugs and issues to the [developers](https://github.com/sjaehnigen/chirpy/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt).

## Examples
Workable binaries can be found in the folder `scripts/` with some pre-implemented *ChirPy* features. Make sure you add this folder to PATH.
